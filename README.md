## 🧩 What is GarageAnd?

GarageAnd is an ultra-simple, open-source platform for managing seasonal garage sales, fundraisers, craft fairs, or local swap events.  
It enables **communities to organize events**, **hosts to manage shared inventory**, and **buyers to reserve items** — all anonymously.

This backend supports:
- Community registration via QR
- Multiple contributors per host
- Buyer-friendly mobile reservation system
- AI-enhanced listing flow (MCP + LLM-ready)
